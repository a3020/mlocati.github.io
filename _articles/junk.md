### NodeJS

To have a working copy of concrete5, you'll need NodeJS, a great engine that allow running JavaScript files and do a lot of wonderful stuff.
[Download](https://nodejs.org/download/) and install it with the default options.
You'll then have mainly two new commands available: `node` (the core program that executes JavaScript scripts) and `npm` (a great tool to manage extra functions of node).

### Grunt
Once you installed NodeJS, you'll need `grunt`: it's great node utility that allows building stuff.
To install it simply open a command prompt and type:  
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
